## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation. We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

- Abstain from discriminatory or harassing behavior and speech.

## Enforcement Procedure

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainers at contact@aerlixconsulting.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.
